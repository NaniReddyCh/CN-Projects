pseudo code: CLASS MemoryEntry:
    - Stores flow details (IP, ports, server, timestamp)
    - Has a method to check expiration based on timeout
    - Allows refreshing the flow's timestamp when it's accessed

CLASS ResponseTimeLoadBalancer:
    - Initialize with a service IP and list of servers
    - Maintain server states (alive, response time)
    - Store a mapping of flows to their respective servers
    - Periodically probe servers for their response time and availability

FUNCTION _do_probe():
    - For each server:
        - Send probe packet (e.g., ARP or ping) to check if the server is alive
        - Measure the server's response time (time between sending probe and receiving response)
        - Store response time and mark server as alive or down based on response

FUNCTION _pick_server():
    - Sort the list of servers by response time (lowest first)
    - If multiple servers are available, select the one with the best (lowest) response time
    - If response times are similar, use round-robin to distribute load

FUNCTION _handle_PacketIn(event):
    - If the incoming packet is for the service IP:
        - Check if the flow (client, destination, ports) is already in memory:
            - If yes, direct the packet to the previously assigned server
            - Refresh the flow entry timestamp
        - If no, pick the best server based on response time:
            - Use `_pick_server` to select the server with the lowest response time
            - Install a flow rule in the switch to forward the packet to the selected server
            - Add the flow to memory for future packets

FUNCTION _do_expire():
    - Check for expired flow entries:
        - If the timestamp is older than the timeout period, remove the flow from memory
        - Ensure the flow is reinstalled when needed

MAIN FUNCTION (launch):
    - Initialize list of servers and set their initial status (alive or down)
    - Continuously probe servers for response time updates
    - Register with the OpenFlow controller to handle packet-in events
    - Handle new incoming packets by directing them to the selected server based on response time
    - Ensure proper flow installation and expiration management
